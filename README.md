# sunset: Retro 80's Aesthetic
This repository contains a vibrant 80's style sunset scene developed in 6502 assembly, designed to run on the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System). The scene features pixel art reminiscent of classic synthwave sunsets, using a limited 8-bit color palette that captures the nostalgic feel of retro gaming.
